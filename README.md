##Working with Classes

This project explores how multiple objects can have different behaviors with the use of more than one class. There are two classes both consisting of snowflakes. The Snowflake class draws smaller snowflakes as one color and are drawn at the top of the screen and fall to the bottom. The Snowflake2 class draws larger snowflakes at the x,y location of the mouse and change color based on that location.

Below is what the program looks like while the mouse is off the screen:
